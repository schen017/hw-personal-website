                        Hi, my name is Stephanie, and this website is my personal website. I am currently a third year
                        Computer Science major at Northeastern University, concentrating in Human Centered Computing.
                        I chose this concentration because I am interested in user experience and design. After taking my
                        first computer science class at Northeastern, I decided to switch my major to CS.
                        My past work experience has involved working as a tutor, a teaching assistant, and a software test
                        engineer, which was my first co-op.
                        I will be interning as a software development engineer this summer in Seattle.
                        Aside from computer science, I am also interested in education. I really enjoy teaching, so I also
                        hope to be able to get more teaching experience in the future!
                        I'm involved in organizations such as Splash (teaching fun workshops to high schoolers), NUSCI (a
                        student-run science magazine), Student Government Association (as a software engineer), and Digital
                        Illustration Association.
                        Some of my favorite classes I've taken at Northeastern so far are PHIL1130 Comparative Ethics and
                        IS4300 Human Computer Interaction.
                        Some of my hobbies outside of computer science are reading and drawing. I've included a list of some
                        of my favorite books below.
                        Although I have not had as much time to read or draw this semester, I'm hoping I will have more time
                        over the summer!
