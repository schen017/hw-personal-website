                        One of my hobbies is reading. These are some of the books that I have read/am reading: Babel by R.F. Kuang, The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley, Yellowface by R.F. Kuang, Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt, and The Women by Kristin Hannah. 
                        I am currently still reading Babel. Babel, published in 2022, is speculative fiction, and it follows a character in 1830s England as he navigates British imperialism and academia. 
                        I think the magical elements that Kuang adds to the historical setting of the book makes the story super interesting. The Ministry of Time is another book I enjoyed reading. 
                        The main character works for a time travel government agency and meets several other characters from different time periods. The next book in the list is Yellowface, which was also written by Kuang.
                        Yellowface is a satirical novel about a struggling author, and although I thought it was entertaining, I think I have been enjoying Babel more. 
                        Remarkably Bright Creatures is an easy to read but interesting story that follows an octopus that lives in an aquarium. Although the story is odd, it ends up being really entertaining. 
                        Finally, The Women is about a nurse who serves in the U.S. army during the Vietnam War.
